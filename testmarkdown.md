# What is Markdown All About?

Markdown is a way to mark text for formatting / syntax. It is similar to HTML except it's much simpler. As the site I'm looking at now says...

> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

And below is a list:
* First
* Second
* Third
 
Apparently, all I have to do in order to signify a code block is to indent the text?

    this is code?
    And this, too, I guess?
      What about this?
